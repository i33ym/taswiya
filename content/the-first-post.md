The whole world is trapped in [tradition](https://quran.com/2/170).

### Problems are not what you see.
Problems are what you do not see. We often think we're clever just like a bird who has seen a small grain on the ground from a mile above. Poor bird... She saw the grain but she could not see the trap.

### When you do not see the Day of Judgement.
God... Save us from this insanity.

### Surah Al-Balad

> I do swear by this city ˹of Mecca˺

> even though you ˹O Prophet˺ are subject to abuse in this city—

> and by every parent and ˹their˺ child!

> Indeed, We have created humankind in ˹constant˺ struggle.

> Do they think that no one has power over them,

> boasting, “I have wasted enormous wealth!”?

> Do they think that no one sees them?

> Have We not given them two eyes,

> a tongue, and two lips;

> and shown them the two ways ˹of right and wrong˺?

> If only they had attempted the challenging path ˹of goodness instead˺!

> And what will make you realize what ˹attempting˺ the challenging path is?

> It is to free a slave,

> or to give food in times of famine

> to an orphaned relative

> or to a poor person in distress,

> and—above all—to be one of those who have faith and urge each other to perseverance and urge each other to compassion.

> These are the people of the right.

> As for those who deny Our signs, they are the people of the left.

> The Fire will be sealed over them.
