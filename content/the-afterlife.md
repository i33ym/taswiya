"Ours is not the caravan of despair." - Rumi
<!-- more -->

Human soul is riddled with intense complexities stemming from the intrinsic need to find meaning to hold on in the midst of life's inherent chaos.
These are not just philosophical or theological puzzles. Humans derive their sense of validation and self-esteem from the meaning they attach to their life. Man when meaning stripped off from his existence is a burden to himself.

In any domain of human endeavor, meaning arises in the intersection of strenous effort and just end. Islam defines the idea of hereafter to encompass ultimately just judgement of individual's entirety of life efforts constituting the ultimate purpose of life that
transcends the mere instinct for survival.

For a believer, it becomes the source of not threat but profound hope in the divine mercy of his Lord deeply interwined with his actions and the lenses through which he looks onto the dunya.
