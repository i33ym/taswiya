[For you is your religion, and for me is my religion](https://quran.com/109/6)
<!-- more -->

I have no idea how many people can hear what I am saying here. Wise people know that the wisdom they're bestowed with is not a ceremony for the collective majority obsessed with sense-pleasure whether that be through materialistic means or "intellectual orgasms". Even the spirituality of the masses revolves around self-indulgence and hedonism.

True wisdom is lethal. It is given to "kill". Kill the false gods incubated in human psyche. It is not to appease the crowd but to disappoint them. So have a backbone and break it for nobody.
